# How to run the code in each folder

- Step 1: Install Node, i recommend using the LTS version.

- Step 2: Check if Node had been installed.

- Step 3: Clone this repository. After that, open the `nodejs-learning` folder aka this project.

- Step 4: Using `cd foo/bar` to change the directory folder to the one you want to test:
  - For example: `cd 01-hello-world` and then `node app.js` to run the program.
  - If you want to go back to the previous directory just hop in the current terminal, press `Ctrl + C` to stop the program from continue running and then type `cd ..\`.
